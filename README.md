# Chat Rules

`Don't beg for points / drip`

`If you want something, ask nicely`

+ Please and thank you go a very long way in both life, and my stream.

`No hit and run self promotions`

+ If we're friends, if you are a regular viewer, I will not get mad if you want to self promote yourself. However, if you come into my stream and broadcast that someone else is live, or that you uploaded a new video and I should react to it (if it isn't a react stream), then your message will be ignored.

`If your message doesn't get read the first time, please retype your message again or use TTS to get my attention`

+ :dove: Streaming isn't an easy thing to do. My eyes are constantly looking between three or more different monitors; reading chat, playing a game, making sure that audio / text to speech / video and the stream is still working properly across two different computers and two different capture cards. I'm basically running a television station all by myself. Please be a patient and understanding viewer and it will be greatly rewarded.

`Don't bring in alts to evade timeout`

+ I timed you out for a reason, your alt will get banned, and then your main account.

`Don't ask to be a moderator`

+ I don't need many moderators, but if I were to ask someone to be my moderator, it certainly won't be someone who begs for it, especially if you haven't been around for very long.

## How Do I Get Drip?

Getting drip is easy as talking in chat every so often. You can also earn drip by catching stars.

Stars spawn across the avatar space, where you can jump to catch them.

`!jump`

## Bosses

Bosses can be fought with viewers. Whe a boss appears, type the command below to review how to play.

`!bossinfo`

You can buy a boss battle for the entire chat for **150 Points**

`!bossfight`

+ :warning: **WARNING** : ASK CHAT IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN A BOSS FIGHT BEFORE BUYING A BOSS!!! It takes at **LEAST TWO PEOPLE TO BEAT A BOSS** sometimes even three people, so if nobody joins, no refunds!

## Battle Royale

You can buy a battle royale for **150 Points**

`!battle`

+ :dove: if I win the battle royale on accident, I will refund your points.

# Text-To-Speech

## SIMPLE RULES TO FOLLOW
:no_entry_sign: **DO NOT:** USE TEXT TO SPEECH TO SPAM ANNOYING, REPETITIVE, OBNOXIOUS MESSAGES.

+ **First time will be a warning, but if you do a second time, your point balance will be set to -1000**
+ **I ask you to use common sense in general when using text to speech. Jokes are fine, long messages are fine as long as they are well thought out, or funny. No hate or vitriol!**
+ **You may see me give a lot of points away to frequent viewers that use text to speech properly! Instead of complaining about not getting free points, use it properly and over time, if I trust you, I will give you lots of points too!**


## How To Use Text To Speech

+ :warning: **WARNING** : You first need to earn points to use text to speech!

### How do I earn text to speech points?

Every FIVE minutes, my bot issues out points to who ever has typed something in chat within those five minutes! Simply participate in chat and you will earn points. These points are also shared with **SFX & REACTIONS**

+ :no_entry_sign: To further clarify, spamming as much as you can will not increase your points! Don't try to spam up chat with random crap to get points! It won't work, and I'll probably just ban you for being an iPad kid for that kind of behavior.

In youtube chat, you will need to type a voice command. The default is !m
Your youtube message should look like this:

+ `!m hello this is my text to speech message!`

**REGULAR SPEAKING VOICES COSTS 15 POINTS TO USE PER MESSAGE**

+ :warning: **WARNING** : **_Just typing "!m" in chat and hitting send will waste your points! You NEED a message after "!m". Points will not be refunded!_**

You can instead replace !m with other voices. The list is:

## Text To Speech Voices

### Male Voices

TikTok Guy:

+ :loudspeaker: `!m (message)`

EXAMPLE: !m hello PB!

### Female Voices

TikTok Girl:

+ :loudspeaker: `!f (message)`

### Special Voices (15 Points)
