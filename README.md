# Text-To-Speech

## SIMPLE RULES TO FOLLOW
:no_entry_sign: **DO NOT:** USE TEXT TO SPEECH TO SPAM ANNOYING, REPETITIVE, OBNOXIOUS MESSAGES.

<sup> **First time will be a warning, but if you do this multiple times, your point balance will be set to -1000!** </sup>

<sup> **I ask you to use common sense in general when using text to speech. Jokes are fine, long messages are fine as long as they are well thought out, or funny. No hate or vitriol!** </sup>

## How To Use Text To Speech
In youtube chat, you will need to type a voice command. The default is !m
Your youtube message should look like this:

`!m hello this is my text to speech message!`

**REGULAR SPEAKING VOICES COSTS 15 POINTS TO USE PER MESSAGE**

:warning: **WARNING** : **_Just typing "!m" in chat and hitting send will waste your points! You NEED a message after "!m". Points will not be refunded!_**

You can instead replace !m with other voices. The list is:

## Text To Speech Voices

### Male Voices

TikTok Guy:

`!m (message)`

EXAMPLE: !m hello PB!

### Female Voices

TikTok Girl:

`!f (message)`

### Special Voices (15 Points)
Ghostface From _**"SCREAM"**_

`!ghostface (message)`

Stormtrooper From _**"STAR WARS"**_

`!stormtrooper (message)`

Rocket Racoon From _**"GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY"**_

`!rocket (message)`

### Singing Voices (35 Points Each)
`!alto (message)`
`!tenor (message)`
`!breezy (message)`
`!chipmunk (message)`
`!dramatic (message)`
`!goesup (message)`
`!sunshine (message)`

EXAMPLE: !sunshine hello PB! how are you today? This is a song I wrote for chat!

:warning: **WARNING** : _**!Chipmunk & !Goesup can only sing up to 3 words! Keep that in mind! (Sorry!)**_
