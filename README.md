# Text-To-Speech

## SIMPLE RULES TO FOLLOW
:no_entry_sign: **DO NOT:** USE TEXT TO SPEECH TO SPAM ANNOYING, REPETITIVE, OBNOXIOUS STUFF.

<sup> **First time will be a warning, but if you do this multiple times, your point balance will be set to -1000!** </sup>

:white_check_mark: **DO:** USE TEXT TO SPEECH

## How To Use Text To Speech
In youtube chat, you will need to type a voice command. The default is !m
Your youtube message should look like this:

`!m hello this is my text to speech message!`

**REGULAR SPEAKING VOICES COSTS 15 POINTS TO USE PER MESSAGE**

:warning: **WARNING** : **_Just typing "!m" in chat and hitting send will waste your points! You NEED a message after "!m". Points will not be refunded!_**

You can instead replace !m with other voices. The list is:

## Text To Speech Voices

### Male Voices
`!m (message)`

EXAMPLE: !m hello PB!

### Female Voices
`!f (message)`

### Singing Voices (35 Points Each)
`!alto !tenor !breezy !chipmunk !dramatic !goesup !sunshine`

EXAMPLE: !sunshine hello PB! how are you today? This is a song I wrote for chat!

:warning: **WARNING** : _**!Chipmunk & !Goesup can only sing up to 3 words! Keep that in mind! (Sorry!)**_
